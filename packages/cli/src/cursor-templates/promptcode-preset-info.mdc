Show details and token count for a specific promptcode preset.

When asked about a preset, run:
```bash
promptcode preset info <preset-name>
```

This displays:
- File patterns included in the preset
- Total file count
- Token count estimate
- List of matched files
- Usage examples

## Optimizing Presets

If the preset has too many patterns or includes too many files, optimize it:
```bash
promptcode preset optimize <preset-name>           # Preview changes
promptcode preset optimize <preset-name> --write   # Apply optimization
```

Optimization intelligently reduces pattern count while maintaining file coverage.

Example: `promptcode preset info backend`
