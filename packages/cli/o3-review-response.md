Below is a two-part review.

PART A – Answers to the six product / UX questions  
PART B – Code-level observations and actionable refactors

PART A – PRODUCT & UX FEEDBACK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Minimalism vs Power  
   • Good call limiting `.claude` to workflows that actually need Anthropic-specific guard-rails.  
   • The only other candidate worth promoting to `.claude` is a “multi-step refactor” flow (e.g. create branch → run `promptcode generate` → commit patch). Anything simpler should stay in the core CLI.  
   • Keep all single-shell calls (`preset list`, `preset info`, etc.) inside the core; they are already AI-friendly.

2. Approval / Confirmation work-flows  
   • Add an opt-in high-token warning to *any* command that could push >N tokens (default 50 k, configurable).  
     Example: `promptcode generate …` → “⚠️ 48 622 tokens will be sent (~$2.50). Proceed? (y/N)”  
   • In `cc` you already confirm destructive actions. Mirror the pattern in `preset delete`, `generate --overwrite`, etc. so UX is consistent.  
   • No need for additional cost estimation inside `preset info`; keep the CLI snappy and let the user/agent decide.

3. AI-friendly Preset Discovery  
   • Implement `promptcode preset search <plain-text>` that fuzzy-matches both file paths *and* comments inside `.patterns` files. Returns a ranked list with match scores.  
   • Add `--describe` flag to `preset info` that prints the first contiguous comment block as a human description. Encourages well-documented presets without changing file format.  
   • Keep it fast: search should be purely filesystem/text; no token counting.

4. Missing but Powerful Patterns  
   • “Inverse preset” (`preset diff`): given a set of patterns, list which tracked files are *not* covered – helps agents discover blind spots.  
   • `preset pull <url>` / `preset share` to import/export `.patterns` snippets—useful for mono-repos.  
   • `generate --dry-run` that prints what *would* be sent (paths + token counts) without reading file contents—handy for quick sanity checks.

5. CLAUDE.md Content  
   • Solid and concise. Consider:  
     – A tiny “Cheat-sheet for agents” table at the very top (command → purpose).  
     – A note that agents can pipe output to `pbcopy` or `xclip` for copy-paste workflows.  
     – One explicit “How to stay within the 100 k token limit” paragraph (chunking, splitting presets).

6. Command Structure  
   • `preset info <name>` is clearer than a flag and enables future sub-verbs (`preset diff`, `preset search`). Good decision; keep it.

PART B – CODE-LEVEL REVIEW
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Path Resolution & Mono-repo Safety  
   Issue: `findClaudeFolder` only checks one parent level. In deep mono-repos (`packages/foo/bar`) the folder may be several levels up.  
   Fix: loop upward with `while (dir !== root)` scanning for `.claude`, stop at filesystem root.

2. Race Conditions on Parallel Invocations  
   Both `createClaudeStructure` and `preset` commands write files unguarded. Concurrent runs (CI + developer) could interleave.  
   • Use `fs.promises.mkdir(..., { recursive: true })` **and** `fs.promises.stat` to bail if another process created the file in-between.  
   • Wrap writes in `fs.promises.writeFile(path, data, { flag: 'wx' })` when you intend “create only”.

3. Token Counter Cache Path  
   `initializeTokenCounter` uses `$HOME/.cache/promptcode`. Respect XDG spec on all platforms:  
   ```
   const cacheDir = process.env.XDG_CACHE_HOME ??
                    (process.platform === 'win32'
                      ? path.join(process.env.LOCALAPPDATA!, 'promptcode')
                      : path.join(process.env.HOME!, '.cache', 'promptcode'));
   ```  
   This avoids failures on Windows where `$HOME/.cache` is non-existent.

4. Interactive Detection  
   `process.stdout.isTTY && process.stdin.isTTY` fails inside Docker with piped input. Provide `--yes` shorthand for `--force` to integrate with CI scripts.

5. Large-Directory Scan Performance  
   `scanFiles` on huge repos can take seconds. Minor tweak: perform glob expansion first, then hand only the matched list to the token counter in a worker thread. Provide a progress bar (`cli-progress`) if >1000 files.

6. Security / Secrets  
   • `.env.example` is great, but add a comment to **never** commit actual `.env` by default: append `.env*` to generated `.claude/.gitignore`.  
   • Mask keys in error messages: if the user passes an invalid key, never echo the raw value.

7. Error Surfacing  
   Every `catch` prints `error.message` but drops the stack. During debugging, add `if (process.env.DEBUG)` to print full trace.

8. Small-Polish Suggestions  
   • Replace `chalk.gray('\nUse --force to update the existing structure')` with `chalk.gray('Run again with --force to overwrite')` – clearer.  
   • In `preset list`, sort alphabetically but show recently modified presets first if `--recent` flag supplied.  
   • Accept kebab *and* camel options (`--create` and `--new`) via yargs alias list; makes CLI forgiving.

9. Type-safety & ESM  
   The files are CommonJS + ES import hybrid. Pick one for consistency (Node 18+ supports ESM natively). If you stay with TS + ESM, run with `"module": "NodeNext"` to avoid dual-module headaches.

10. Tests  
   Edge cases not yet covered:  
   • Running `preset delete` while a `generate` is reading the same preset.  
   • Creating a preset whose name clashes with an existing directory (`api`). Ensure `.patterns` suffix avoids FS collisions.  
   • `cc --uninstall --force` when `.claude` is a symlink (possible in workspaces). Use `fs.lstat` to guard.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TL;DR
• The high-level design is sound: keep most logic in the core CLI, reserve `.claude` for long, multi-step expert flows.  
• Add a lightweight “token cost warning” and a fuzzy `preset search`.  
• Harden the `cc` search path, guard file writes, and tune performance on huge repos.  
With these tweaks PromptCode CLI should feel simultaneously minimal, powerful, and safe for both humans and AI agents.
