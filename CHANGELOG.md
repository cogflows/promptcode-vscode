### Fixed
- Critical search functionality in VS Code extension
- File selection state management issues
- Core package integration bugs

## [0.5.1] - 2025-08-12

### Added
- **Cursor IDE Integration**: New `promptcode cursor` command creates `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for Cursor IDE integration
- **Enhanced CLI Documentation**: Added 8 new comprehensive example sections covering real-world use cases
- **Shared Integration Utilities**: New helper module for managing AI agent integrations (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

### Fixed
- Documentation URLs now correctly reference `main` branch instead of feature branches
- Markdown formatting issues resolved across all documentation files
- Security: Added path validation for git command execution to prevent injection attacks

### Breaking Changes
- **CLI Parsing**: Commands must now be explicitly specified. Previously `promptcode "question"` would implicitly run the expert command, now you must use `promptcode expert "question"`. This change improves clarity and prevents ambiguous command interpretation.
