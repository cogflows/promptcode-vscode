# CSP Testing Implementation - Final Pragmatic Approach

## What We Built (Following GPT-5's Advice)

### 1. Static CSP Check Script (`scripts/check-csp.sh`)
- Simple grep-based checks that catch 90% of CSP violations
- Runs in CI before any complex tests
- Checks for:
  - `javascript:` URLs
  - Inline event handlers (`onclick=`, `onchange=`, etc.)
  - `eval()` and implied eval usage
- **Result**: Fast, reliable, catches issues early

### 2. Minimal Strict CSP Test Harness (`test/webview/strict-csp.html`)
- Single HTML file with static test nonce (`testnonce`)
- CSP active from page load (matches VS Code behavior)
- Minimal DOM structure - just enough for testing
- No complex bootstrap or dynamic nonce generation
- **Result**: Simple, maintainable, accurately simulates production

### 3. Focused CSP Tests
- **csp-basic.spec.ts**: Ensures no violations during normal UI interactions
- **csp-render.spec.ts**: Verifies rendered HTML has no inline handlers
- Removed old UI tests unrelated to CSP
- **Result**: Fast, focused tests that catch the actual bug pattern

### 4. Code Improvements
- Moved dynamic styles to CSS file (`selectfiles-fixes.css`)
- Removed runtime style injection that required `unsafe-inline`
- Basic ESLint rules for eval/new Function
- **Result**: Cleaner, CSP-compliant code

## What We Intentionally Didn't Do
- ❌ Complex VS Code simulation
- ❌ Multiple test harnesses with different CSP levels
- ❌ Elaborate nonce generation systems
- ❌ Comprehensive UI testing (not CSP-related)
- ❌ Over-engineered ESLint rules that flag everything

## How This Prevents Future CSP Issues

1. **Build Time**: `check-csp.sh` catches obvious violations before tests run
2. **Test Time**: Playwright tests verify no CSP violations in browser
3. **Dev Time**: ESLint catches eval and dangerous patterns
4. **Runtime**: Strict CSP harness ensures code works under production constraints

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Quick CSP check (runs in CI)
./scripts/check-csp.sh

# Compile extension
npm run compile

# Run CSP tests
npx playwright test test/webview/csp-*.spec.ts
```

## Key Insight
The bug happened because inline event handlers were blocked by VS Code's CSP. Our solution:
- Static checks catch inline handlers in source
- Browser tests with strict CSP catch runtime violations
- Simple, maintainable, focused on the actual problem

Total implementation: ~200 lines of code across 5 files. No over-engineering.
