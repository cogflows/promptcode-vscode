# Test Plan for Additional Critical Fixes (Round 2)

Following expert review from GPT-5, O3-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, we've implemented additional critical fixes.

## New Fixes Implemented

### ðŸ”´ Security Fixes
1. **Enhanced Path Validation** (buildTreeFromSelection.ts)
   - Now checks for `../`, `/`, absolute paths, and `/../` patterns
   - Prevents all known path escape vulnerabilities

### ðŸŸ¡ Correctness Fixes  
2. **Glob Pattern Case Sensitivity**
   - Fixed case handling - pattern preserves original case
   - Regex uses 'i' flag for case-insensitive matching

3. **Empty Directory State Preservation**
   - Empty directories now preserve their checked state
   - Only sets to unchecked if not previously in the map

4. **Multi-root Workspace Support**
   - Ignore patterns now save to ALL workspace folders
   - Uses vscode.workspace.fs for proper file operations

5. **Async Queue Error Handling**
   - Proper error propagation in checkbox queue
   - Shows user-friendly error messages
   - Queue continues after errors

## Test Scenarios for New Fixes

### Security Testing
- [ ] Try to select files with path `../../../etc/passwd` - should be rejected
- [ ] Try paths starting with `/` - should be rejected  
- [ ] Try paths with `/../` in middle - should be rejected
- [ ] Verify console warns about invalid paths

### Glob Pattern Testing
- [ ] Search for `*.TS` (uppercase) - should find .ts files
- [ ] Search for `Test*.js` - should match test.js and TEST.js
- [ ] Verify case-insensitive matching works correctly

### Empty Directory Testing
- [ ] Check an empty directory
- [ ] Refresh the tree
- [ ] Verify empty directory stays checked
- [ ] Add a file to the directory
- [ ] Verify parent state updates correctly

### Multi-root Workspace Testing
- [ ] Open multi-root workspace
- [ ] Edit ignore patterns
- [ ] Save configuration
- [ ] Verify .promptcode_ignore created in ALL workspace folders
- [ ] Check each file has same content

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Create a file/directory with restricted permissions
- [ ] Try to check it
- [ ] Verify error message appears
- [ ] Verify tree still refreshes
- [ ] Verify other operations continue working

## Performance Verification
- [ ] Search performance with debouncing (200ms delay)
- [ ] Large directory selection doesn't freeze
- [ ] Tree operations remain responsive

## Regression Testing
- [ ] All original fixes still work
- [ ] Search expand works correctly
- [ ] Tri-state checkboxes function properly
- [ ] Path-aware search works
- [ ] Tests still pass
